  [Pull Request #329](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/pull/329)
* **server** will now set the SNI hostname before connecting over TLS.
* **relay** a new flag `-E` was added to disable disconnecting idle

  gzip compression leaking half closed sockets
* [Issue #341](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/341)
  after SIGHUP with changed config relay no longer accepts connections
* passing a directory as config file silently succeeds with empty config
  as result


# 3.3 (23-03-2018)

### New Features

* **dispatcher** tags support was added, it is only activated when the
  `;` character is *not* in the list of allowed characters (`-c` flag).
  Note that by default this character is not allowed, hence tags support
  enabled.
  [Issue #311](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/311)
* **dispatcher** support for oniguruma, pcre2 and pcre regex libraries
  was added.  These libraries perform all better than the libc
  implementation, bringing down cpu time of the relay considerably.

### Bugfixes

* Fix conffile.tab.h dependency for parallel make.


# 3.2 (21-10-2017)

### Notes

* The deprecated `-S` and `-m` options were removed.  Use the
  `statistics` configuration file construct instead.
* The `-i` option was removed.  Use tue `listen` configuration file
  construct instead.

### New Features

* **relay** the flag `-tt` can now be used to test the configuration and
  exit immediately.  In this mode, any standard output is suppressed as
  well.
  [Issue #247](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/247)
* **relay** the `listen` construct was added to precisely control listen
  ports and protocols.
* **server** unresolvable hosts are now treated as failed servers, this
  means the relay will only warn about unresolvable hosts, but not error
  out.  If a host becomes unresolvable this server is transitioned to
  failed state until it is resolvable again.
  [Issue #293](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/293)
* **relay** compression and encryption support was added to listeners
  and servers.
  [Issue #212](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/212)

  aggregator expiry deadlocks under pressure
* [buckytools Issue #17](https://github.com/jjneely/buckytools/issues/17)
  consistent-hash implementation returns a different distribution with
  the binary search approach


# 3.1 (29-04-2017)

### New Features

* **router** a new `route using` clause was added to `match` rules to
  set the string to be used as key for consistent-hash based clusters.
  [Pull Request #235](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/pull/235)
* **consistent-hash** node traversal is now done through a binary search
  instead of forward pointer chasing.

### Bugfixes

* [Issue #261](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/261)
  unable to use numeric instance name
* [Issue #262](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/262)

* [Issue #264](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/264)
  carbon\_ch hash algorithm change between 2.6 and 3.0


# 3.0 (2017-04-07)

### Notes

* Parsing of the configuration file has changed implementation in this
  version.  Should you find problems with configurations that worked
  fine before, please report the problem.
* The use of `send statistics to` is now deprecated, use the new
  `statistics send to` instead.
* The use of statistics controlling flags `-S` sending interval and `-m`
  summary mode, are now deprecated because they can be set in the
  configuration.

### New Features

* **collector** statistics now can be controlled via the configuration
  file using the new `statistics` clause.  This overrides some command
  line flags, and adds some new posibilities.
* **router** the rewrite rule got a new replacement mode: `\.`  This
  mode replaces all dots with underscores in the matched group.  A
  combination with upper/lowercasing is possible, e.g. `\_.`.
* **collector** one can now set the internal statistics prefix

  [Issue #113](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/113)
  [Issue #249](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/249).

### Bugfixes

* **server** when connecting to a hostname, now /all/ resolved addresses
             are tried in order before failing
* **relay** A new `-O` flag allows to set the minimum rules threshold
            before trying to optimise the rules.

### Bugfixes

* [Issue #246](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/246)
  using `stop` in a `match` rule does not stop metrics from being
  processed afterwards

* [Issue #193](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/193)
  race condition in aggregator leads to crash
* [Issue #195](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/195)

  Various race conditions reported by TSAN


# 2.1 (16-06-2016)

### Enhancements

* **router** the optimiser now tries harder to form groups of
  consecutive rules that have a matching common pattern

### Bugfixes

* [Issue #180](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/180)
  include directive possibly overrides previous included components
* [Issue #184](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/184)
  router optimise doesn't work correctly with regex groups

# 2.0 (30-05-2016)

### New Features
* **router** `include` directive was added to add content of another
             file, see also [Issue #165](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/165).  The include can also use glob patterns, see [Pull #174](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/pull/174)
* **server** the number of stalls performed on writes can now be
             controlled (and also disabled) using the `-L` flag.
             [Issue #172](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/172)

### Breaking Changes

### Enhancements
* **server** incomplete writes are now retried a couple of times before
             they are considered fatal.  This should reduce the amount
             of messages in the logs about them, and be more like the
             consumer expects, e.g. less sudden disconnects for the
             client.
* **router** reloading the config now prints the difference between the
             old and the new config in `diff -u` format.
* **router** reloading the config now maintains the queues for the
             servers, such that unavailable servers don't get metrics
             dropped.

### Bugfixes
* [Issue #154](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/issues/159)
  when a store becomes a bottleneck it shouldn't indefinitely stall

  based on a random timeout

# 1.5 (13-01-2016)

### Enhancements
